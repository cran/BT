# BT : (Adaptive) Boosting Tree for Poisson distributed response variable.

## Aknowledgements

The author thanks Julien Trufin and Michel Denuit for their support during the project.

The idea behind (A)BT is akin to the Gradient Boosting Methods. 
This package is therefore inspired by the `gbm3` one, originally written by Greg Ridgeway <greg.ridgeway@gmail.com> (for more details, please refer to the following [url](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm3)).
Some of the developed codes are then pretty similar.
